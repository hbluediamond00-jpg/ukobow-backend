    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 26, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Ukobow</strong>. We value your trust and strive to provide a transparent
      experience. This policy outlines the terms regarding cancellations and refunds for hotel bookings made through our
      platform.</p>

    <h2>1. Cancellation Rules</h2>
    <p>Cancellation policies vary depending on the specific hotel and rate selected. However, the standard Ukobow
      platform rules are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free Cancellation:</strong> Bookings cancelled at least <span class="highlight">24 hours</span> before
        the scheduled check-in time are eligible for a full refund (excluding platform convenience fees, if any).</li>
      <li><strong>Late Cancellation:</strong> Bookings cancelled within 24 hours of check-in will incur a charge
        equivalent to the first night's stay plus taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Refundable Rates:</strong> Some specific "Deal" or "Premium" rates are non-refundable. This will
        be clearly mentioned on the booking confirmation page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No-Show Policy</h2>
    <p>If you do not check in on the scheduled date ("No-Show") and do not cancel the booking beforehand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The reservation will be released automatically the next day.</li>
      <li>No refund will be issued for the booking amount.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Refund Process & Timelines</h2>
    <p>If you are eligible for a refund according to the rules above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Refunds are initiated by Ukobow within 24 hours of cancellation.</li>
      <li><strong>Bank Credit:</strong> The amount will reflect in your original payment source (Credit Card, UPI, or
        Bank Account) within <span class="highlight">5 to 7 business days</span>, depending on your bank's processing
        speed.</li>
      <li><strong>Ukobow Wallet:</strong> If you chose a wallet refund, it will be credited instantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Payment Gateway Charges</h2>
    <p>In cases of customer-initiated cancellations, the payment gateway transaction fees (approx 2%) may not be
      refunded, as these are levied by the banking partners.</p>

    <h2>5. Hotel-Specific Policies</h2>
    <p>Please note that Ukobow acts as an intermediary. Individual hotels may have specific policies during peak seasons
      (e.g., New Year, Holidays). The specific policy displayed on the Hotel Details page during booking takes
      precedence over this general policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Check-in Denials</h2>
    <p>If a hotel denies check-in due to a fault on their end (e.g., overbooking), Ukobow will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide an alternative hotel of similar quality at no extra cost, OR</li>
      <li>Issue a full 100% refund immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: Refunds are not issued if check-in is denied due to lack of valid ID proof by the guest.</em></p>
